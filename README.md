# Welcome to your CloudGo AI Project: aws-bucket

## Project Info

**URL**: https://cloudgoai.app/Home#Chat/PNfdPIPE8D7n7DYA4UUL

This repository contains a **Terraform project generated with CloudGo AI**.

It is scaffolded with:
- **Deployment scripts** for installing required tools and deploying infrastructure.
- **Validation scripts** (linting, security checks) to ensure correctness.


For more details about the Terraform code itself, see the [terraform/README.md](./terraform/README.md).

## Quickstart

You can use this project locally or though github actions.

### Local

```sh
# 1. Clone this repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd aws-bucket

# 2. Install dependencies
./scripts/install.sh

# 3. Validate the configuration
./scripts/check.sh

# 4. Deploy the infrastructure
./scripts/deploy.sh
```

Read the [github workflow doc](docs/cicd-setup-aws.md) for more details on how to use the github actions instead.

## Requirements

- Terraform (installed automatically via scripts/install.sh, but you can install manually if preferred).
- Cloud provider CLI (AWS CLI, gcloud CLI, or Azure CLI depending on the selected provider).
- GitHub Actions (optional) for CI/CD automation.
- Infracost if you want to re-run or adjust cost estimation.
